        <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1/3 c. bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 c. finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, combine beef with bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, egg, garlic,

        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, 
            until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meatballs to a plate.</li>
